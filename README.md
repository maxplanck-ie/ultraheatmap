# ultraheatmap

ultraheatmaps facilitates the production of [deepTools](https://github.com/deeptools/deepTools)
heatmaps. The heatmaps typically show signal at genomic regions, which can be
appended by orthogonal data, like associated gene expression. ultraheatmap
facilitates adding orthogonal data to a deepTools matrix and allows to cluster a
genomic heatmap by selected samples in just one single command-line call.


## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of ultraheatmaps up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The Prerequisites can be found in requirements.yaml

### Installation

First clone the repository

             git clone https://github.com/maxplanck-ie/ultraheatmap.git

From with in the repository, create a conda environment from yml (yaml)

              conda env create -f requirements.yaml

Then activate the environment:

              source activate ultraheatmap

To install the program in this environment:

              python setup.py install

from the ultraheatmap directory. Now, you already have the program installed and can access each of the modules by calling them. Try

              computeOrderedMatrix -h

or

              AddFeatureToMatrix -h

To terminate the environment run:

              source deactivate

### Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
